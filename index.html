<h1>swimming</h1>

<p>I love to go swimming. I’ve been swimming every since i was 5 or 6 years old. I started swimming lessons around the 3rd grade and went all the way throughout middle school. Swimming is my passion. It gets my mind off things and it helps me with my breathing and improving my leg and arm strengths. </p>

<p>I would always go swimming over my grandpa’s house over the summer with my family. I would always swim in the deep end because i like a challenge. My brother and i would race to try to get the toys at the bottom of the pool. And sometimes we threw each other in. Here’s a picture of a pool.</p>

<h2>exercise</h2>

<p>I also like riding bikes. I rode bikes with my aunts and cousins growing up. We would go around the neighborhood and to the park with our bikes. I like riding bikes because its really fun and its good exercise. It gets my heart rate up and gives my legs a good stretch.</p>
<p>This is a good biking company <a href="http://bicycleadventures.com/"> biking tours</a>.</p>

<h2>Yoga</h2>

<p>I do yoga mostly on sundays because thats when i have the most time. Yoga is one of my favorite hobbies because it helps my breathing patterns and helps my back. It also improves my flexibility.</p>
